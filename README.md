## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the `okra-node` package. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install okra-node
```

## Getting Started

First, you'll need an API key from Okra. Once you have your API key, you can start using the okra-node in your application. 

```javascript
const OkraNode = require('okra-node');

const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
const okra = new OkraNode(apiKey);
```

## Usage

The okra-node provides methods for interacting with various Okra API endpoints. Here's an example of how to use the client to retrieve authentication data by ID:

```javascript
okra.getAuthById('your-auth-id')
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

You can similarly use other methods to access different Okra features like getting account details, transactions, balance, and more.
